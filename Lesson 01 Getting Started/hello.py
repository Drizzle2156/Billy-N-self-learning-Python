CHAPTER 1: GETTING STARTED
Installed Python interpreter (IDLE + Python Launcher) from www.python.org. The interpreter allows for the Python REPL or SHELL which reads a piece of code, evaluates it, and then prints the result to the console in a loop.
Installed VS Code which is a source code editor. 
Ran into issue, Not being able to launch Python Launcher like before r/learnpython. Got the problem with the popup window answered. 
Just set open .py files with Python launcher app
Install the Python extension from Microsoft. Extensions allow us to add languages and core functionalities to VS Code
Run code in the terminal using the python3 command, don't type in the $

Created a Python file titled hello.py and ran it 3 ways
Carrot button -> run python file
The other 2 ways required adding the folder I made which creates a workspace. Before I was just running the hello file without the folder added. 
Then it enabled me just to type in python3 hello.py in the terminal to run, or right-click and run the python file in the terminal
