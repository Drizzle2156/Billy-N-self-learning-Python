To clear the terminal screen in macOS, you can use the `clear` command or a keyboard shortcut:
1. Using the `clear` command:
   Open the Terminal application (you can find it in the "Utilities" folder within the "Applications" folder) and simply type:
   clear
   Press the Enter key, and the terminal screen will be cleared, giving you a clean, empty screen.

2. Using a keyboard shortcut:
   You can also use a keyboard shortcut to clear the terminal screen:
   - Press `Command + K` (âŒ˜ + K) simultaneously.
   This keyboard shortcut will also clear the terminal screen, just like the `clear` command.
Keep in mind that clearing the terminal screen will not delete any history or previous commands; it will only remove the visible output from the screen, making it easier to work with a clean interface.
