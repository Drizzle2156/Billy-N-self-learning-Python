In arcade i need to give ability to just loop through if i dont pick 1 or 2. then Need to give rps and guess games ability to come back to arcade.py when hitting Q.

# need to figure out how to make the name global so that it wont reset to Gamer when switching between modules. Update on 1/11/2024. so apparently global variables only work in the file it was created, however when doing the import statement it already imports all the variables from that module..
# in order to transfer the name between modules, just do rps_main(name) and guessnumber_main(name). didnt need to do global or anything

# none is the default but gets replaced by the args.name
